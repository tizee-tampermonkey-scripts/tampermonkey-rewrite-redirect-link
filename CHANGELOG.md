### 💼 Other

- Chore(version): Bump version to 1.6.3 and fix resolver prompt logic 🚀

- Updated script version from 1.6.2 to 1.6.3 in `rewrite-redirect-link.js` because we're moving fast! 🏎️

Time to make those YouTube redirects even smoother! 🎥✨

This change ensures the script is up-to-date and uses a more generic URL for the expand link API. 🌐
